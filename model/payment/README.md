# openapi-payment-client
 Invoicing and Payments is a fundamental area of Yagna Ecosystem functionality. It includes aspects of communication between Requestor, Provider and a selected Payment Platform, which becomes crucial when Activities are executed in the context of negotiated Agreements. Yagna applications must be able to exercise various payment models, and the Invoicing/Payment-related communication is happening in parallel to Activity control communication. To define functional patterns of Requestor/Provider interaction in this area, Payment API is specified.

An important principle of the Yagna Payment API is that the actual payment transactions are hidden behind the Invoice flow. In other words, a Yagna Application on Requestor side isn’t expected to trigger actual payment transactions. Instead it is expected to receive and accept Invoices raised by the Provider - based on Application’s Invoice Accept notifications, the Payment API implementation orchestrates the payment via a configured Payment platform.

**NOTE: This specification is work-in-progress.**

### pip install

If the python package is hosted on a repository, you can install directly using:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git
```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git`)

Then import the package:
```python
import openapi_payment_client
```

### Setuptools

```sh
python setup.py install --user
```
(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import openapi_payment_client
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_payment_client
from openapi_payment_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

configuration = openapi_payment_client.Configuration()
# Configure Bearer authorization: app_key
configuration.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'

# Defining host is optional and default to http://localhost/payment-api/v1
configuration.host = "http://localhost/payment-api/v1"

# Defining host is optional and default to http://localhost/payment-api/v1
configuration.host = "http://localhost/payment-api/v1"
# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_payment_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_payment_client.ProviderApi(api_client)
    debit_node_id = 'debit_node_id_example' # str | 
timeout = 60 # float | How many seconds server should wait for acknowledgement from the remote party (0 means forever)  (optional) (default to 60)

    try:
        # Cancel Debit Note.
        api_instance.cancel_debit_note(debit_node_id, timeout=timeout)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling ProviderApi->cancel_debit_note: %s\n" % e)
    
```
