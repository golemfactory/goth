# Level 0 mocked requestor agent

This test runs a requestor agent using the mocked client api code generated by Swagger / openapi-generator.

To generate the agent code you should:
- clone ya-client containing the swagger definitions
- run `combine-mocks.sh [../../../ya-client]` ( default expects ya-client to be beside yagna-integration)
- Apply manual patches ( when required )
- run `test.py`
