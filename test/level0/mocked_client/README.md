# Level 0 mocked requestor agent

This test runs a requestor agent using the mocked client api code generated by Swagger / openapi-generator.

## To generate the agent code:

- clone ya-client containing the swagger definitions
- install openapi-generator@5.x and add it to your path https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation
  - _ I have added the alias `alias openapi-generator='java -jar ~/Downloads/openapi-generator-cli-5.0.0-20200424.033601-40.jar'`
- run `cd test/level0/mocked_client` followed by `sh combine-mocks.sh [../../../ya-client]` ( default expects ya-client to be beside yagna-integration)
- Apply manual patches, cherry pick all required


## To run the test:

- `python setup.py develop` OR `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root of the `yagna-integration` repository
- run `cd test/level0/unix` followed by `sh ./start_mocked_requestor.sh`
